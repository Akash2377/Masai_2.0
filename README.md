## **☠️ Problem statement ☠️**
## Consider you have to create a website using CRUD which contains

1. Creating a user (user can be a student, admin, or a super-admin)
2. On the homepage user is able to see all the courses offered by the company
3. Once the user clicks on any course there are some conditions
>• If the user has bought that course then he can see all the lectures in it
> else the user can preview 1st lesson in it and for others, he has to buy that course
6. A lecture contains the lecture name, lecture description, and lecture video (you can use youtube videos for reference)
7. Make a payment gateway for purchasing the course after purchase user should be able to see the course
9. Profile section where the user can add his basic info and see all the courses that he has enrolled
10. Make a wishlist where the user can add any course to buy it later this can also be seen in the profile section, the user can also delete the course from the profile section
11. Cart page where user can see all the courses added to the cart 
12. An admin can add any number of lectures in a course, also update the previous lecture,s and can also delete a lecture
13. A super admin can add any course and update or delete any course other than all admin features
14. Admin and super admin can see all the courses
